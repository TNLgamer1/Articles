        <h2>
            In the 1800s, women didn't have the same rights as men. Women didn't have the ability to<br>
            own property, vote, have the legal status of children, seek divorce, sign legal documents, and needed <br>
            to get permission from their husband or father to work at a job. It was believed that a woman's <br>
            primary duty in society was to stay home and raise children, which was called the Cult of Domesticity. <br>
            <br>
            Due to this, many great leaders such as Lucy Stone started the women's rights movement. <br>
            The Seneca Falls Convention in New York was then held in 1848 by Susan B. Anthony and <br>
            Elizabeth Cady Stanton, where they would later publish the Declaration of <br>
            Sentiments. In the Declaration of Sentiments, it said that women should possess the same <br>
            rights as men in order to have equal opportunity for things like jobs, property and the <br>
            right to vote, which is known as suffrage. <br>
            <br>
            Despite this powerful movement, not all women or men believed in gender equality. Women who<br>
            were in the realm of traditional gender roles argued that politics were not proper for women. <br>
            There are some that even believed that voting may cause some women to grow beards. Traditional <br>
            roles for genders being revamped upheld by the struggle for equality didn't land well with some <br>
            women and of course men as well. <br>
